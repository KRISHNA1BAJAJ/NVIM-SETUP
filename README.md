My Neovim Setup
This is my personal Neovim configuration, built for speed, minimal bloat, and modern development workflows.
Tested on Windows with NvChad as the base config.

Features
NvChad for UI, theme, and sane defaults

Mason for easy LSP, formatter, and debugger management

clangd for C/C++ development

Lazy.nvim for plugin management

Keybindings optimized for quick compile/run cycles

Support for multiple languages (C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS)

Requirements
Neovim (>= 0.9)

Git

Node.js & npm (for certain LSPs)

Python 3 (with pynvim)
